## Travel to the Boot Camp
- Instructors book their own travel
- Instructors book their own lodging
- Instructors meet in hotel, morning of Day 1
- Instructors walk to site and find location for themselves

**Recommendations**
- Require hosts to book travel and lodging for instructors (rather than instructors book and are reimbursed)
- Send a local person to escort instructors to boot camp site

## Classroom setup
- Divided classroom
- Just over 40 seats

## Tech Resources
- Two free-standing projector screens
- No internet access prepared; 30 minutes to get a guest login

## Installation
- Three instructors and three tutors supervise installation
- At least one outdated Mac OS that cannot install software
- 9:30, class has still not started due to installation issues

## Assessment
- Google Forms assessment prepared for boot camp
- Form distributed by putting tinyurl for form on an overhead
- Participants asked to fill out survey while other install issues are resolved
